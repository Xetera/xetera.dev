![Basketweave-S](./header.jpg)

Hello! In this blog post, we'll be going through the build process of the <T>Basketweave-S</T> mechanical keyboard.

#### Links
[DIY kit on 42keebs.eu](https://42keebs.eu/shop/kits/basketweave-s-ergo-65-kit-black)  
[Build guide](https://github.com/piit79/basketweave-s/blob/master/doc/build.md)  
[QMK fork](https://github.com/piit79/qmk_firmware)

## About the board

The Basketweave-S is a 65% mechanical keyboard with Alice-like layout.

Below I've listed everything you will need to turn it from a board into a working mechanical keyboard

As for this build, the parts we will be using are the following:  
**Switches: Durock Lavender, 65g**  
**Lube: Krytox 205g0**  
**Films: Deskeys films**  
**Keycaps: [ePBT Shadow Version A](https://kbdfans.com/products/ic-epbt-shadow)**  
<PartsList />

As for my tools, I'm using a TS100 soldering iron.

![TS100 soldering iron](./iron.jpg)

## Introduction

I've always wanted to try out an Alice-style board. I think they look cool.
I don't believe they are any better than a standard keyboard layout from an ergonomical viewpoint, but they have this very nice <T>aesthetic</T> to them.
Especially since you can see the components through the acrylic panel, gives it a very nice retro vibe. Also worth noting that the **revision of my board is 1.9**.


As you might have noticed, in some pictures the board is white whereas in others it's black.
This is because I didn't take enough pictures of the assembly process when I was building it, so I'm using images I took when my friend was assembling his own Basketweave-S at my place.




## Soldering the area around the MCU
This part is straightforward, just follow the build guide and make sure to pay attention to the orientation of the components as stated in the build guide.

For inserting the ATmega32a, the pins might be a bit too "wide" around the socket. This is easily remedied by pushing the flat side of the pins against the table so they turn _slightly_ inwards.


## QMK Setup

For my QMK setup, I'm using [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu. I mainly develop using Linux/MacOS, WSL2 allows me to run Linux tooling on my main gaming PC.

#### Prerequisites

This part will cover installing QMK on WSL2 with Ubuntu.
Shamelessly copied from [QMK's newbs guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started) so this may be subject to change.

```bash
sudo apt install -y git python3-pip
python3 -m pip install --user qmk
qmk setup
```

QMK should now be set up.

#### Grabbing the repo and building for QMK

In this part we will clone piit's build of QMK with the firmware for the Basketweave-S and build it.

```
qmk clone piit79/qmk_firmware
qmk compile -kb 42keebs/basketweave_s -km default
```

This will output a `.hex` file which is the built firmware into `~/qmk_firmware/42keebs_basketweave_s_default.hex` if you installed QMK into the default location.

#### For <Toast text="Vial is an open-source cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) GUI and a QMK fork for configuring your keyboard in real time. ">Vial</Toast>

There is a pull request on piit's fork of QMK for adding <Toast text="Vial is an open-source cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) GUI and a QMK fork for configuring your keyboard in real time.">Vial</Toast>
support.  
[QMK fork of piit's fork, for Vial support](https://github.com/IvoPo/qmk_firmware/tree/basketweave-s-vial)

These instructions will help you install Vial support, in case it's not merged by the time this post is published.

```
qmk clone IvoPo/qmk_firmware
cd ~/qmk_firmware
git checkout basketweave-s-vial
qmk compile -kb 42keebs/basketweave_s -km vial
```

If it's already merged, you can simply run `qmk compile -kb 42keebs/basketweave_s -km vial` to build it with the Vial keymap.

# Flashing QMK onto the ATmega32a

<QMKToolBoxHeader />

If you're using [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox), you can simply point the `Local file` to the compiled `.hex` file. **Remember to select ATmega32a for the MCU.**  

If your Basketweave-S is not showing up as a connected device, try holding the **boot** button on the top of the PCB to put it into bootloader mode when plugging in the USB-C cable.

![QMK Toolbox flashing](./qmktoolbox.jpg)

#### Flashing on Linux using QMK
I haven't tried this myself, but you should be able to flash it onto the MCU from the command line by running:
```bash
cd ~/qmk_firmware
# For QMK
make -kb 42keebs/basketweave_s:default:flash
# For Vial
make -kb 42keebs/basketweave_s:vial:flash
```
