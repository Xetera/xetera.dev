# ⚗ So... What's Elixir?
Elixir is a dynamically typed, functional programming language created by [José Valim](https://twitter.com/josevalim) in 2012.
The language has a strong emphasis on <T>concurrency</T>. Elixir compiles to bytecode that runs on the <T>Erlang / BEAM</T> virtual machine.
You could say Elixir is to Erlang the same thing as Kotlin is to Java. In it's language constructs, Elixir is very similar to Erlang.

#### So what is Erlang then?
Erlang is a general-purpose functional programming language created by [Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson) in 1986, intended for use in telecommunications systems.
Telecommunications is inherently concurrent with many possible telephone calls happening at once in the system, so they adopted a programming model that supports many different actors running concurrently.
It was released as open-source software in 1998.

#### ... BEAM?
**BEAM** is the virtual machine that runs bytecode generated by Elixir compiler.
If we return to the previous analogy comparing Kotlin to Java, you could say that the BEAM virtual machine is what JVM is to Java.
**BEAM** is built with distribution and fault-tolerance as it's core principles.

#### How is Elixir different?
Elixir has much friendlier syntax, mostly taking inspiration from [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). As mentioned before, it's language constructs for the most part match those of Erlang.  


Thanks to the **BEAM** VM, interop between Erlang and Elixir is very easy. This allows you to leverage the battle-tested functionality and packages of Erlang while also leveraging the more comprehensive standard library of Elixir.
Let's borrow a page from the [Elixir Crash Course](https://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html) and take a look at the differences in syntax.  

Both of these examples print `Hello world!` to the console.
```erlang {title: "hello_world.erl"}
-module(hello_world).
-compile(export_all).

hello() ->
  io:format("~s~n", ["Hello world!"]).
```

```elixir {title: "hello_world.ex"}
defmodule HelloWorld do
  def hello do
    IO.puts "Hello world!"
  end
end
```
Personally, I *much* prefer the Elixir syntax.

Let's compile and run the Elixir example in `iex` which is an interactive shell for Elixir.
```shell
Interactive Elixir (1.13.0)
iex(1)> c("hello_world.ex")
[HelloWorld]
iex> HelloWorld.hello
Hello world!
:ok
```
Now obviously when you're developing you don't want to be constantly reloading your modules. There's tools like <T>Mix</T> that automate those tasks and much more.
