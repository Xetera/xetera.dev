Back when AI generated images were the hot new thing in 2023, I got a midjourney subscription and figured it would be cool to add images to my articles. I thought it was nice at first, but it's been feeling more and more unsettling to look at, knowing that it's built entirely on top of stolen work. I'm no longer going to use AI images.

import slop from "./ai-slop.jpg"
import {Image} from "astro:assets"

<Image alt="an obviously AI generated image of a Porsche on sale for $150 with smeared text and 4 different speedometers" class="sm:float-right sm:ms-8 h-[400px] object-cover" width={300} src={slop} />

I had the unfortunate experience of running into this obviously AI generated framed picture of a Porsche with four deformed speedometers while browsing a furniture store with my girlfriend and her parents today. I didn't want to annoy them too much with a rant there, but seriously, what value does this image provide? It's low resolution af because they probably just upscaled a generic image from dall-e or midjourney. It looks like shit. And it's literally not even a real car. In a normal sale of an art piece there's a person getting something they probably think is an impressive work of art, and a person facilitating that sale. In this instance, there's only a person who's getting screwed over like someone who didn't read the fine print of a contract they signed, and another person laughing.

My current avatar is AI generated, but I like the style enough to not toss it in the garbage immediately. If you're an artist or know someone with an art style similar to what I've got on the homepage, [feel free to hit me up](https://bsky.app/profile/simp.engineer) for a commission so I can replace it with human art.
