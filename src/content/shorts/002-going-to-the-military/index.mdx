Turkey has an active conscription. Which means Turkish guys between ages 21 and 41 are required to go to the military for 6 months, and that time has finally come for me too. I didn't _just_ turn 21. I postponed it at age 20, and since I'm no longer in school, I'm now required to attend. Massive bummer.

I'm going down the paid military service route to get a reduced sentence at just 1 month as opposed to the standard 6 months, by paying a mind-boggling `$6000`. If you've been living and working abroad, you get to pay that amount and not attend at all. But I only started working full time after coming back to Turkey, so that's not an option for me unfortunately. Once you're in the military, you're not allowed any electronics other than a non-smart phone for making phone calls and texting during off-hours. SMS YUCK! So this will be the longest time I'll have spent without a computer, or without constantly being plugged in.

There's little to no information about what this process is like in English, so I'll document my time there with pen and paper or on my blackberry and share it here when I'm out. I'll be leaving on April 5th and returning on the 30th. ðŸ‘‹ See you then.
